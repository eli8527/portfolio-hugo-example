  This website was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It is set using the same typographic stylesheet that [Michael Fehrenbach](https://michaelfehrenbach.com/) and I developed for use in [moma.org](https://www.moma.org/). The typefaces used are Arnhem and Neue Haas Grotesk.

Hi, I’m Eric — I’m a designer and software engineer with 7+ years of experience based in New York. I see software as a medium through which good design exists, and care significantly about craft and execution.

At the Eames Institute, my role as Digital Product Director is to oversee and translate all the amazing work we do to our digital surfaces. My work ranges from design and development to strategy; and mainly covers the website, as well as the myriad of other digital platforms we use to share the lessons of Ray and Charles Eames. I am a firm believer in moving/building iteratively and thinking deeply, working across physical and digital boundaries to ensure the best user experience for our visitors.

Prior to joining the Eames Institute, I was the Senior Product Designer and Developer at MoMA, where I led product design, front-end, and digital strategy of the Museum’s website and other digital surfaces. In addition to MoMA, I have worked at Cinder, <nobr>O-R-G</nobr>, Google Design, IDEO, and LUST. 

I also teach interaction design and computer science at Parsons, and have been an invited guest at Princeton, Yale, NYU, SVA, TCNJ, Rutgers, Pratt, CCA, RISD, and UPenn.

<!-- I graduated with a B.S.E. in computer science and visual arts from Princeton, where I was the 2018 recipient of the Jim Seawright Award in Visual Arts. -->
