## Getting started

In this directory, run `docker compose up` if you have Docker installed. 

### Hugo CLI

If you don’t have Docker installed or prefer to use the CLI, use `brew install hugo` or follow these [instructions](https://gohugo.io/installation/). 

## Folders

- `.github/workflows` is a hidden folder for building your site on GitHub and deploying it to a GitHub pages instance
- `archetypes`
- `assets` is for any files such as stylesheets and scripts that need to go through Hugo’s asset pipeline. These assets are processed by Hugo whereas files in `static` are not
- `content` is where all your content goes
- `layouts` are where your templates go. Hugo combines your `content` with `layouts` to create your website
- `public` and `resources` are generated by Hugo and you don’t need to touch them
- `static` is for all static assets which can stand alone, such as fonts.

## Custom Domain

Let’s say you are adding `yourdomain.com` to your website. In addition to DNS updates, you have to do the following below:

- Update `config.yaml` by modifying `baseURL` to your custom domain
```yml
baseURL: http://yourdomain.com/
```

- Edit `.github/workflows/hugo.yml` by uncommenting the `cname` and adding your custom domain:

```yml
- name: Deploy
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./public
        cname: yourdomain.com
```
